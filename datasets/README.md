## Downloading datasets

At the moment the project uses only the `iris` dataset which can be found publicly at [UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)

A helper shell script has been included to perform the downloading task, it can be ran by issuing the following commands:

```sh
./download-datasets.sh
```
